# open-data
Norway is finally united - public transport - wise üòç. On 2017-11-02, our good friends in Entur launched the Norwegian national travel planner, as well as a platform for open public transport data and APIs.
At Ruter Labs, we will encourage all users to migrate to Entur's open platform at http://dev.entur.org for open data on GTFS and NeTEx formats, as we will discontinue our own open data publishing here on Github in January 2018.
Entur also has a first version of their open API platform, but are working on an improved version, so you could stick to our REIS API which will be maintained by us until further notice. We will let you know when it's time to kiss goodbye! üòò

## Open APIs

We have two open APIs for you to use:
* [Reis 2 API](http://reisapi.ruter.no/help) for journey planning and departure times
* [SIRI SX API](http://sirisx.ruter.no/help) for deviation messages connected to public transport stops or lines

## Licence
Our open data and APIs are licenced under the Norwegian [Licence for Open Government Data (NLOD)](http://data.norge.no/nlod/en).
